Noise echo server is a jupyter notebook simple implementation of Noise Echo Server that bahaves similarly to Noise-C echo server.

This notebook is based on two libraries [Noise-C Library](https://github.com/rweather/noise-c/) and [Python NoiseProtocol](https://github.com/plizonczyk/noiseprotocol)

## Noise protocol framework
Noise is a framework for building crypto protocols. Noise protocols support mutual and optional authentication, identity hiding, forward secrecy, zero round-trip encryption, and other advanced features.

## Installation

```bash
export ROOT=my-noise-root
```

### Noise-C Library
Noise-C is a plain C implementation of the Noise Protocol, intended as a reference implementation. It can also be referred to as "Noisy", which is what you get when you say "Noise-C" too fast. The code is distributed under the terms of the MIT license.

```bash
cd $(ROOT)

git clone 
```
